# Pneumonia Detection Using CNN 
 
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images using deep learning. The model was trained and evaluated using the Kaggle Chest X-ray dataset.

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images using a CNN model. The dataset contains images labeled as "pneumonia" or "normal," and the model predicts the presence of pneumonia based on the image features.

## Objectives
- Build and train a CNN model for pneumonia detection.
- Use image preprocessing techniques to improve model accuracy.
- Evaluate the model using classification metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [Chest X-ray Pneumonia dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) from Kaggle, which contains labeled images of X-rays for both pneumonia and normal categories.
